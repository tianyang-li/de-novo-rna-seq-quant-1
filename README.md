=======================

![The model](https://github.com/tianyang-li/de-novo-rna-seq-quant-1/raw/master/README/model.png)

This is a tool used for Bayesian de novo transcript reconstruction and abundance estimation from RNA-Seq data.

This program uses sequence graphs (splicing graphs) produced by  [Trinity](http://trinityrnaseq.sourceforge.net/).

The version of Trinity used here is [trinityrnaseq_r2012-06-08.tgz](http://sourceforge.net/projects/trinityrnaseq/files/trinityrnaseq_r2012-06-08.tgz/download).

In order to build this tool, the latest stable release of [Cython](http://cython.org/) is required.

Utilities from [https://github.com/tianyang-li/misc-bioinfo-0](https://github.com/tianyang-li/misc-bioinfo-0) are used for data preprocessing.

This project attempts to improve previous methods based on observations from [https://github.com/tianyang-li/human-rna-seq-analysis-0](https://github.com/tianyang-li/human-rna-seq-analysis-0).
