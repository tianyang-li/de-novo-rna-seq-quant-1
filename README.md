de-novo-rna-seq-quant-1
=======================

This is a tool used for de novo transcript reconstruction 
and abundance estimation from RNA-Seq data.

This program uses sequence graphs (splicing graphs) produced by 
[Trinity](http://trinityrnaseq.sourceforge.net/).

The version of Trinity used here is 
[trinityrnaseq_r2012-06-08.tgz](http://sourceforge.net/projects/trinityrnaseq/files/trinityrnaseq_r2012-06-08.tgz/download).

In order to build this tool, the latest stable release 
of [Cython](http://cython.org/) is required.

This project attempts to improve previous methods based on observations from [https://github.com/tianyang-li/human-rna-seq-analysis-0](https://github.com/tianyang-li/human-rna-seq-analysis-0).
