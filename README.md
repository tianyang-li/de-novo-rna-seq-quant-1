de-novo-rna-seq-quant-1
=======================

De novo quantification of RNA-Seq data.

This program uses sequence graphs (splicing graphs) produced by [Trinity](http://trinityrnaseq.sourceforge.net/).

The version of Trinity used here is 
[trinityrnaseq_r2012-06-08.tgz](http://sourceforge.net/projects/trinityrnaseq/files/trinityrnaseq_r2012-06-08.tgz/download).

This program should be run on a platform where `long double` is supported.
